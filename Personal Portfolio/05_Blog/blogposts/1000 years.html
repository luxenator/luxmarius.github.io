    <h2><strong>Antifragility</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It must have been close to 2 years ago that I read "Antifragile" by Nassim Taleb and even though I took quite a lot out of this book, there is one rather small sentence that I remember most.</p>
<p>"I only eat what's been there for at least a thousand years" Or something like that.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this sentence for a while now, turning it over and over in my head, trying to figure out if this is actually a good approach to healthy eating.</p>
<p>For those of you who never heard about Taleb. Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a Lebanese-American essayist, scholar, mathematical statistician, and former option trader and risk analyst, whose work concerns problems of randomness, probability, and uncertainty. That fact that I copied this out of Wikipedia makes this, almost certainly, no less true.</p>
<p>So what does a person with his background have to do with nutrition? Especially in a book that is about antifragility?</p>
<p>We'll I think especially the last three objectives, mentioned in his short bio above, might give us a hint about his 1000 year conclusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 data-line-height="xl" data-padding="40px"><strong>"randomness, probability, and uncertainty"</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p data-line-height="xl" data-padding="40px">What else falls quite neatly in those categories? Anyone?</p>
<p>Exactly. Evolution.</p>
<p>However, is someone who gives you nutritional advice based on evolutionary facts better than someone who does it based on science or personal experience?</p>
<p>Let's try to find that out with a quick dive into today’s nutritional science. Especially within the last years, the science around nutrition has led to many breakthroughs as more and more studies are being conducted. All trying to figure out what makes us sick and what keeps us healthy. And the more we dive into analysing our relationship to food, the clearer the connections between food and disease get. Especially civilisation diseases like obesity, diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Microbiome - key to health and disease</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The latest findings point to one key element that connects food to health. Our microbiome. A microbiome is a collection of microorganisms that includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses and their respective functions. Our microbiome has a diversity that is so great that no two humans share the same microbiome. It is what truly differentiates us from one another. </p>
<p><em>One quick side note here. There is a difference between microbiome and microbiota. The microbiota is the collection of microorganisms in a specific environment such as the gut. The microbiome refers to the microbiotas function in regards to the genes present in the microbiota. But to keep things easier I’ll be using the term microbiome.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keeping this microbiome healthy and in balance between the different strains of bacteria, fungi, viruses and archaea is the main factor for our overall health.</p>
<p><em>By the way, archaea are small single cell organisms. Just for those who wondered.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Feeding our Gut</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>But how do we keep our little friends healthy? What do they eat? And why do we need them?</p>
<p>Like all “living” creatures on this planet, our microbiome has to eat to stay alive. And eating also means, well, pooping. Or let’s call it “transforming”. Without our microbiome we wouldn’t be able to break our food down into all the components we are able to absorb, such as vitamins, minerals etc. And different species produce different substances and chemicals. Some are tremendously good for us while others are detrimental to our health. So basically a perfect diet should feed the microorganisms that produce good stuff, while it starves those who produce harmful substances. But how would a diet like this look like?</p>
<p>Let’s shed some light on it. </p>
<p>What is interesting to mention is that the human microbiome can change. To both the good and the bad. This can be absolutely necessary in some case, but also destructive to our health in others. But let me explain.</p>
<p>A few thousand years ago (and still in some indigenous populations) the human microbiome changed with the seasons. In periods where plants, fruits and nuts were in abundance, species of microbes that feed off those components were more prevalent in our guts. In periods where plant food is scarce (winter), other meat-digesting microbes were helping us to digest the food that we can access in those relatively scarce times.</p>
<p><em>Another side note: As some might have guessed, there is no snowy, cold and harsh winter in every part of the world. Some humans had little changing diets due to less extreme seasons. This might explain why different people around the world are used to different foods and ways of eating and it might emphasise the thesis that we should not all eat the same. But I haven’t looked into this topic enough to give you a definitive answer on that. Feel free to do some research and let me know what you came up with!</em></p>
<p>This has worked out pretty good for around 99% of human evolution. We had time to adjust to changes and even though I am sure that a prehistoric human had the occasional upset stomach, they were pretty healthy overall. Interestingly, hunter-gatherers would have had the same life span as we have, if you take modern conveniences such as penicillin, surgeries and a low death birth rate into context. Ah and maybe, the occasional sable tooth tiger that grabs your slower cousin.</p>
<p>But something must have happened within the last 50-100 years. We have this fancy modern medicine that is keeping us from dying from infections, broken bones and much more. Nevertheless, we are struggling to cope with an emerging and steadily growing type of disease. Especially autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>An autoimmune disease is the overreaction of the body’s immune system. It's like the guys that are keeping us safe suddenly lost the ability to distinguish between friend and foe and therefore attack healthy cells. And the results manifests itself in various conditions such as cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders, rheuma etc, etc.</p>
<p>But wait a second. If our ancestors were capable of living up to our life span without getting those diseases. What changed?</p>
<p>The way we live. Nothing less. We do not move as much anymore. Instead of walking 20km or more everyday we decided to sit in comfy chairs. Not really what we are anatomically made for. We switched short bursts of stress (e.g. running from a wild animal) to a chronic lingering stress and anxiety that slowly chips our health and sanity away. Everything needs to be as fast as possible. We even breathe too fast. This results in our heart beating faster than it should, thus creating even more stress.</p>
<p><em>Stop now and try to breathe in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds. That’s the perfect breathing speed. Already feeling relaxed? Good. Do it more often now.</em></p>
<p>But probably the most important change happened on our plates and consequently in our microbiome. Our meals contain less fibre, we have no seasonal variety and our food is filled with substances that we would normally not even touch. On average we eat around 5-15 different plants every week. This is only a fraction of the variety a cave dweller ate a thousand years ago. And yes, we almost certainly always ate meat. But not every day. And we ate insects, which we don't anymore at all. At least in the west.</p>
<p>What changed? What foods are we eating now that we did not eat for the majority of evolution?</p>
<p>I don't really want to list the usual culprits such as sugar, processed food etc, so let's just say it like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>We used to eat for fuel. Now we eat for satisfaction.</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We used to eat what was available and our microbiome got used to it. We developed to crave foods that are especially high in nutrients (and usually scarce) so we don’t die off too quickly and have enough time for reproducing. <em>(Hint: this is what evolution is all about)</em> But with food being readily available and in abundance we started to eat what makes us happy, what tastes good. In short: We feast on what we learned to crave over centuries.</p>
<p><em>Another side note: I actually think its fine if not each meal is tasty. Try to approach food with the fuel side sometimes. Eat something healthy with the intention of fuelling yourself and you will feel the same kind of satisfaction afterwards. Give it a try!</em></p>
<p>But its not only our eating habits that changed rapidly. Although many foods we ate a thousand years ago are still around, they are not what they used to be.</p>
<p>I think you have seen those pictures of certain fruits and vegetables and how they changed over the last century.</p>
<p>Thick skins turned into smooth peels, enormous seeds are all but disappeared and we swapped bitterness and sourness for intense sweetness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take this ancient watermelon for example. Looks sweet and juicy doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Humans altered their food in order to make it satisfy our ancient cravings. But with what intention?</p>
<p>Firstly, increased consumption and the accompanying economic advantages. The backbone of our current society. Big corporations try everything to make plants easier to produce, easier to process and better tasting without really asking one important question. Will the outcome be good for us or only for our (their) wallets?</p>
<p>I don’t want to say anyone did that with bad intend. Actually I’m pretty happy that I don’t have to eat a banana that resembles more a zucchini than an actual banana but still, we played ourselves a bit here.</p>
<p>In my opinion the biggest problem is the possibilities we have. We can modify plants to our liking and with the occasional good intend to feed more people and make them healthier. Or in other cases, for the pure sake of money.</p>
<p>But the question is if its smart to change what our bodies adapted to over thousands of years? It’s like spending decades developing an engine that runs on a special type of fuel and once the engine is done we are improving the fuel. Without even looking at the engine again. Sounds like we will be walking instead of driving.</p>
<p>The good thing is that there are some farmers that are discovering the old plants again. Those who evolved with us and might have been bred selectively but only over long periods of time. The problem is that those vegetables are still everything but common, quite expensive and only a small part of humanity can afford them. But things are changing and I think we are on a good way to get a bit of that healthy stuff back that we ate for such a long time. So maybe consider buying the occasional vegetables from a local farmer that is not being whipped by big corporations. And if you don’t have the means to source good food all the time try to cut out the bad ones first.</p>
<p>A good first step would be to start cooking yourself. Do meal prep once a week and see how easy and cheap it is to get better food down to your microbiota. (a bit of self promoting: have a look at my meal prep section. Delicious, quick, healthy and affordable. Try it out!)</p>
<p>Back to the original question:</p>
<p>Should we all eat food that has been around for a thousand years?</p>
<p>Probably. Assumed that you check where it comes from and how it’s being grown.</p>
<p>But do we need to eat foods that have been around for a thousand years to be healthy?</p>
<p>Most certainly not. Our bodies are quite good in handling the occasional “bad” or unhealthy food if we fell victim to our cravings again. But it should only be a rare occasion.</p>
<p>If someone would ask me for a recommendation, I’d probably suggest something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat as many different plants as possible, organically grown and not genetically modified</li>
<li>Avoid food that clearly emerged within the last 100 years and if you crave some of it, see it as a treat. And nope, you don’t buy treats every day and in the same quantity as healthy stuff. Remember, you can’t eat what’s not at home. Bad bacteria hate this trick.</li>
<li>Lastly, eat good quality meat if you feel like it but don’t see is as a staple. (Good quality also means raised and butchered in good conditions!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now before you go and put all this newly gained wisdom into action, I have a challenge for you. Cook your next meal with 5, 10 or maybe even 20 different plants. You do not have to find entirely new recipes, just cook what you always cook but with an increased plant diversity. You’ll love it! Let me know in the comments below what you made.*</p>
<p>I hope you took something from this post and if you did, I’d be delighted if you share it with a friend.</p>
<p>And remember, food is not only about us. It’s mainly about the billions of microorganisms that break that food down into either bad or good components. Based on what you feed them.</p>
<p>It’s your choice.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Really.</p>
